# Multi-Class-Ordinal-Logistic-Regression
The project involved the development of a multi-class ordinal logistic regression model for the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Survey competition. 

Here, I have trained, validated, and fine-tuned a multi-class ordinal logistic regression model capable of classifying a survey respondent's current yearly compensation based on the set of survey responses provided by the respective data scientist. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of survey results from 25,973 participants, with 369 columns representing the survey questions.
